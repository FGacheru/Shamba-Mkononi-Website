                    <p>
                        At Shamba Mkononi we envision a future filled with vibrant <br> farms that are able
                        to meet the needs of the comunity. <br>We believe using technologies like GIS and 
                        precision farming <br> which can help build human capacity, revitalize communities,<br>
                        supply regional food systems,<br> and gradually eliminate famine and food insecurity.

                    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
                    <p>
                        We work with various partners whose vision and purpose <br> align with ours of ensuring
                        that we eradicate hunger and work <br> towards fulfiling the UN-SDG Goal 2; Zero hunger.<br>
                        That said the bulk of our projects have been in Nyeri county, <br>Kirinyaga county and
                        Uasin Gishu county as they are the counties <br>that produce the bulk of food in the country.<br>
                        We are however committed to expanding our boundaries<br> and equiping more farmers with the knowledge,<br>
                        expertise and resources required for them to florish.

                    <h2>RESOURCES</h2>
                    <P>
                        We pride ourselves in not only offering practical ways <br> to farm sustainably but also
                        offer resources<br> to the farmers ever so often that enable them <br>to keep upbreast withup to date
                        knowledge on best farming resources.<br>
                        This is possible through the use of GIS technology<br> that allows us to carry out Precision 
                        farming <br>by the use of remote sensing technology as well<br> as carrrying out suitabilty analysis.<br>
                        The use of this technologies allows us to provide <br>the farmers with data that is precise to the <br>
                        soil profile, climatic condition, land demacation,<br> metrological reports among other aspects that allow the farmers<br>
                        to get the maximum results from their farms.<br>
                        Maps, resource people, up to date data bases<br> are among the resources that we offer our
                        farmers.
