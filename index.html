                        <p>
                            At Shamba Mkononi we envision a future filled with vibrant <br> farms that are able
                            to meet the needs of the comunity. <br>We believe using technologies like GIS and 
                            precision farming <br> which can help build human capacity, revitalize communities,<br>
                            supply regional food systems,<br> and gradually eliminate famine and food insecurity.

                            that we eradicate hunger and work <br> towards fulfiling the UN-SDG Goal 2; Zero hunger.<br>
                            That said the bulk of our projects have been in Nyeri county, <br>Kirinyaga county and
                            Uasin Gishu county as they are the counties <br>that produce the bulk of food in the country.<br>
                            We are however committed to expanding our boundaries<br> and equiping more farmers with the knowledge,<br>
                            expertise and resources required for them to florish.
