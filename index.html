        ABOUT US
        At Shamba Mkononi we envision a future filled with vibrant farms that are able
        to meet the needs of the comunity. We believe using technologies like GIS and 
        precision farming we can help build human capacity, revitalize communities,
        supply regional food systems, and gradually eliminate famine and food insecurity.

            <div class="Projects">
        We work with various partners whose vision and purpose align with ours of ensuring
        that we eradicate hunger and work towards fulfiling the UN-SDG Goal 2; Zero hunger.
        That said the bulk of our projects have been in Nyeri county, Kirinyaga county and
        Uasin Gishu county as they are the counties that produce the bulk of food in the country.
        We are however committed to expanding our boundaries and equiping more farmers with the knowledge,
        expertise and resources required for them to florish.

            <div class="Resources">
        We pride ourselves in not only offering practical ways to  farm sustainably but also
        offer resources to the farmers ever so often that enable them to keep upbreast withup to date
        knowledge on best farming resources.
        This is possible through the use of GIS technology that allows us to carry out Precision 
        farming by the use of remote sensing technology as ell as carrrying out suitabilty analysis.
        The use of this technologies allows us to provide the farmers with data that is precise to the 
        soil profile, climatic condition, land demacation, metrological reports among other aspects that allow the farmers
        to get the maximum results from their farms.
        Maps, resource people, up to date data bases are among the resources that we offer our
        farmers.
